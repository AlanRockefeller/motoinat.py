# iNaturalist Observation Finder

This script allows you to find iNaturalist observations that correspond to specific Mushroom Observer (MO) observation numbers. It supports retrieving data from a list of numbers or from a file and offers multiple output options, including URLs or observation IDs only.

By Alan Rockefeller - May 15, 2025

## Version 1.1
- Supports https or http MO URL's
- Supports the new mushroomobserver.org/obs/ URL's

## Features
- Search for iNaturalist observations based on Mushroom Observer numbers.
- Support for inputting observation numbers directly or via a file.
- Output options:
  - Full details of the matched observation (species, location, etc.).
  - iNaturalist observation URL only.
  - iNaturalist observation number only.
- Debug mode for detailed request and response information.

## How the Script Works
The script performs the following steps to find a corresponding iNaturalist observation for a given Mushroom Observer number:

1. **Constructing URLs:**
   The script generates potential Mushroom Observer URLs using the provided observation number. For example:
   - `http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_observation/{mo_number}`
   - `https://mushroomobserver.org/{mo_number}`

2. **Making API Requests:**
   These URLs are used as query parameters in requests to the iNaturalist API. Specifically, the script searches for observations on iNaturalist where the "Mushroom Observer URL" field matches the generated URLs.

3. **Evaluating Responses:**
   - If the iNaturalist API finds one or more matching observations, the script extracts the details of the first match. 
   - Details include the iNaturalist observation ID, URL, species guess, and location.
   - If no matches are found, the script reports that no corresponding iNaturalist observation exists for the given Mushroom Observer number.

### Detection Conditions
For the script to detect a corresponding iNaturalist observation:
- The iNaturalist observation must have a custom field named "Mushroom Observer URL."
- The value of this field must exactly match one of the URLs generated by the script for the given Mushroom Observer number.

If these conditions are not met, the script will not detect a corresponding observation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `argparse`
  - `json`

## Installation
Clone or download this repository and ensure the required libraries are installed. Use the following command to install missing libraries:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage
Run the script with the desired Mushroom Observer numbers or specify a file containing observation numbers.
